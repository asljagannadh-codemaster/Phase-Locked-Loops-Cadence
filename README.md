# Phase-Locked-Loops-Cadence

The Phase Locked Loops are very important in the industry, as well as the heart of mobile phones. 
I had tried to implement the small prototype of PLL in Cadence using 65-nanometer technology. All cannot access the Cadence software, and the circuit files cannot be taken out of Cadence; hence, I did a report on each and every circuit I implemented inside this project. The calculations are also included in the report attached. The results for every small block to test individual functionality are also included in the report for clear documentation. The final circuit and final plots are in the ending option of the report as well. 

For a quick view the final loops implementation circuit diagram is given below:

The corresponding output is given below:

All the internal block design and their individual simulation outputs are in the above report. Please look into the report for more information.
